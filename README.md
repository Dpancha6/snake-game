# Snake Game in Python with Pygame

A classic implementation of the popular Snake game built using Python and the Pygame library.

## Description

This project is a recreating of the classic Snake game, where the player controls a snake that grows in length as it eats food. The objective is to navigate the snake through the game board while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body. The game features score tracking, power-ups, and a visually appealing design.

## Installation

To run the Snake game, you'll need to have Python 3.x and the Pygame library installed on your system.

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd snake-game
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

To start the game, run the following command:

```
python main.py
```

Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement:

- Up arrow: Move up
- Down arrow: Move down
- Left arrow: Move left
- Right arrow: Move right

## Game Rules

- The game begins with a snake of a certain length displayed on the game board.
- The objective is to navigate the snake and eat the food (represented by a red square) to increase its length and score.
- Periodically, power-ups (represented by yellow squares) will appear on the board. Collecting a power-up will grant additional benefits, such as increasing the snake's length or score.
- The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.

## Features

- Score tracking: The player's score is displayed on the game window and increases as the snake eats food and collects power-ups.
- Power-ups: Power-ups randomly appear on the game board, granting benefits like increasing the snake's length or boosting the score.
- Visually appealing design: The game features a dark background with contrasting colors for the snake, food, and power-ups, making it visually appealing.
